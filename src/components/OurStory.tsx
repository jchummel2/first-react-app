          Leah and Joel first met on a dating app, Hinge, and began talking on
          July 15, 2023. They talked for a little over a month before having
          their first date. Leah was still living in Fort Dodge, and Joel was
          living in Urbandale. They decided to meet halfway in Ames, Iowa. They
          ate at a Mexican restaurant, El Azteca, and finished the date by
          going to the movie theatre and watching Barbie.
        </p>

        <p>
          On August 27, 2023, Joel and Leah began officially dating. They began
          long-distance dating for the next year and a half. In September 2023,
          Leah met Joel&apos;s family for the first time and spent the weekend
          at the pumpkin patch and sightseeing in Des Moines. In October 2023,
          Joel met Leah&apos;s entire family at her brother&apos;s wedding
          (pretty intimidating!).

        <p>
          In January 2024, Joel and Leah bought their first dog, Lila Rose. Joel
          and Leah spent the majority of 2024 raising Lila and going on
          countless fun dates, traveling back and forth from Fort Dodge to
          Urbandale. They even went to Cancun, Mexico.
        </p>

        <p>
          In February 2025, Joel and Leah bought their first house together.
        </p>

        <p>
          On March 8, 2025, Joel popped the question and asked Leah to marry her
          at Gray&apos;s Lake (of course, she said yes!).
        </p>

        <p>
          They will marry on October 24, 2026 at the Country Lane Lodge in
          Adel, Iowa.
